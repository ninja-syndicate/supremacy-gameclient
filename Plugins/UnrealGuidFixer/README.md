# GuidFixer
UE5 Plugin (5.0) for resolving conflicting material IDs that cause errors in Swarm build and conflicting texture IDs that cause errors in texture streaming builds.

After placing in project>plugins, regenerating and stuff you should have new buttons under "Tools" in the toolbar in a section called "GUID Fixer"
Load that problematic level, click the button and then Save All.

Much love and thanks to the original SwarmGuidFixer plugin by laggyluk, as well as the forums post it originated from.
